### Use command @shrt for making shortcut command of Git Clone packages

### Use @shc for package based command shortcuts . For Example python , bash , figlet , fish etc.
Lets take a example as if we shorted python command to p command then 
we have to use only p wherever python is required . For example 
we have to write python script.py for running particular script.py
but after this tool we have to command only p script.py .

$ @shrt
```
